	The third proejct is not that different from the second project except the gon back n. With the ga back n, I tested, and the result tells me that it is faster than the second project. I have no idea why that my client only sends to my server no matter what IP address I give to it. With that being said, the relay does not work as well. However, the server and the client work perfectly if we don't not deal with the relay or using other machine to test it.
